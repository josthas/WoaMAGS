There are two licences used in libcda.  The following licence covers
all files in the libcda package, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

  [For informational purposes, this is the zlib licence.]


------------------------------------------------------------------------


Some files are derived from another package called BCD.  I emailed its
author about changing the licence, but received no reply.  Therefore
the original licence remains on files that were originally from BCD.

The following licence covers these files ONLY: djgpp.c, bcd.doc


  You may use, modify, redistribute, and generally hack it about in
  any way you like, but if you do you must send me something in
  exchange.  This could be a complimentary copy of a game, an addition
  or improvement to BCD, a bug report, some money (this is
  particularly encouraged if you use BCD in a commercial product), or
  just a copy of your AUTOEXEC.BAT if you don't have anything
  better. If you redistribute BCD or make a game using it, it would be
  nice if you mentioned me somewhere in the credits.

(The author of the licence is Brennan Underwood.)


If necessary, you may remove the BCD-derived files when including the
libcda package _as part of your source tree_.  Do not distribute
libcda as a standalone package with files missing.
