      <h2 align="center"><b>Getting Started with AGS - Part 7</b></h2>
      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
      <h3>Animations</h3>
      <p>A graphical adventure game would be no good without animations. These
      range from commonly-used animations such as the main character walking, to
      a flag waving in the background in one particular screen.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">Animations in AGS are managed using <i>Views</i>. A view is a set of
      one or more <i>loops</i>. A loop is a set of frames which, when played in
      sequence, give the illusion of movement. Expand the &quot;Views&quot; node
      in the project tree, and double-click the view 1:</p>
      <p align="center"><i>
		<img border="0" src="images/intro7_1.jpg" width="544" height="394"><br>
      The View Editor showing view 1</i></p>
      <p>This is the View Editor where you will put together all your 
		animations. You'll notice lots of frames of Roger's walking animation in 
		this window.</p>
      <p>Each loop is displayed as a row of images (one for each frame), going
      from left to right. To change the image for a frame, double-click the
      image, and you'll be presented with the sprite manager where you can
      select the image to use. <b>All images for use with views are imported as
      usual via the sprite manager </b>before they can be inserted into a frame.<br>
      At the right hand end of each loop, you'll see a &quot;Create new frame&quot; 
		button, which you can click to create a new extra frame at the end of
      the loop. You can also right-click a frame to insert a new one before or
      after it.</p>
      <p>Left-click a frame to select it. When you do so, the property grid will 
		be updated with the frame's details:</p>
		<p align="center"><i>
		<img border="1" src="images/intro7_2.jpg" width="475" height="321"><br>
      	Property Grid showing frame properties</i></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
		<p dir="ltr"><b>Delay</b> is the frame's <b>relative</b> speed. This number adds
          a delay to the amount of time which the frame is displayed for,
          therefore a larger number makes it stay longer. You can use negative
          numbers to specifically shorten the frame's display time.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><b>Sound</b> allows you to assign a sound number that will
          get played when this frame comes around in the animation. This feature
          is designed for footstep sounds, but has many other uses as well.
          Using sound will be covered later in the tutorial.</li>
        <li>
		<p dir="ltr"><b>Flipped </b>toggles whether the frame is displayed 
		normally or mirrored left-right. This feature allows you to just create 
		animations for your character walking right, and then use the same 
		images for the walking left loop and AGS will automatically flip them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Views aren't only used for character walking animations -- they're used 
		for all types of animations in the game. How you actually run an animation in 
		the game will be
      explained later on.</p>
      <h3>Characters</h3>
      <p dir="ltr">If you remember back to part 3 of this tutorial, we talked about three
      types of thing that the player can interact with - hotspots, objects and
      characters. We've covered the first two, so now it's time to take a
      look at characters.</p>
      <p>Put simply, a character is similar to an object, except that it can
      move between different rooms in the game, take part in conversations,
      carry its own inventory and more.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">Expand the &quot;Characters&quot; node in the project tree. You'll see that
      so far you only have one character in the list, labelled &quot;0:
      cEgo&quot;. You can create a new character by right-clicking the &quot;Characters&quot; 
		node. For now, double-click the &quot;cEgo&quot; character:</p>
      <p align="center"><i>
		<img border="0" src="images/intro7_3.jpg" width="558" height="385"><br>
      The Character Editor</i></p>
      <p dir="ltr">The first thing you'll notice is the text &quot;This character is the player character&quot; 
		at the top of the window. This shows that the currently selected
          character is the initial player character when the game starts up. The
          game will start off in whatever room number the <i>Starts in room</i>
          option is set to for the player character. To change it, simply open 
		up the character that you want to use instead and click the &quot;Make this 
		the player character&quot; button.</p>
		<p dir="ltr">There are quite a few properties available in the property 
		grid. Rather than
      explain them all here, we'll just cover the most important ones - you can
      find a full description of all the options in the manual.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
		<p dir="ltr"><b>StartingRoom</b> - this sets which room number the character
          starts off in at the beginning of the game.</li>
        <li>
		<p dir="ltr"><b>NormalView </b>- sets which view is used for the normal walking
          animation of the character. The view specified here must have 4 or 8
          loops, and the first frame of each loop is the standing still frame.<br>
          For a 4-loop character, when walking diagonally the closest straight
          direction is chosen for display. With an 8-loop character, all 8
          directions are displayed depending on the character's direction.<br>
          Which loop represents which direction is shown in the Views editor (eg.
          &quot;Loop 0 (down)&quot;).&nbsp;</li>
        <li><b>Clickable</b> - if this is not checked, then this character will be
          see-through to mouse clicks. This is similar to the way the player
          character worked in Lucasarts games - you cannot actually click on
          Guybrush, it will always activate whatever is behind him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The character's &quot;<i>RealName</i>&quot; field simply gives you an easy
      way to identify the character in the editor, and can also be accessed from
      the game script if desired.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">The &quot;<i>ScriptName</i>&quot; field is very important, as it 
		sets the name by which the character will be referred to in the game 
		scripts. The reason for having this as well as the RealName is that the 
		script name can only contain the letters A-Z, whereas the <i>RealName 
		</i>field
      can contain any spaces, numbers, etc.</p>
      <h3>Game starting point</h3>
      <p>Just in case you missed it, I'll repeat what was just said in the
      Characters section - the &quot;<i>Starts in room</i>&quot; setting of the
      player character is used to determine which room the game starts off in.</p>
      <table border="0" id="table3">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">
			<img border="0" src="images/icon_info.gif" width="32" height="32"></td>
          <td><b>TIP:</b> This feature can be handy for testing various parts of
            your game. For example, when you're working on room 16, set the
            starting room to room 16 so that you can get to it instantly when
            you run the game to test it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Cutscenes</h3>
      <p>You can easily add intro, outro and cutscene sequences to your game.
      There is no specific feature to do this - you simply use the provided
      animation and movement commands to do whatever you like.</p>
      <table border="0" id="table4">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">
			<img border="0" src="images/icon_info.gif" width="32" height="32"></td>
          <td>A <i>cutscene</i> is simply the name given to a sequence of
            actions over which the player has no control. This usually applies
            to the entire introduction sequence, as well as far simpler in-game
            events. For example, if the player goes to pick up a rock from the
            ground, you may wish to use a bending-down animation to show him
            picking it up. During this bending down and standing back up, the
            player cannot control proceedings, so it is a cutscene.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Right, firstly let's do something very simple. When the player goes to
      pick up the key from the floor of our room, we want him to walk over to it
      first rather than it just disappearing from wherever he's standing.</p>
      <p>So, we want to add something extra to picking up the key. How do we do
      this? Yes, that's right, we need to return to the Event Script for the key 
		object. Go back to the Events List for the key object (remember, you 
		open the room, select the &quot;Objects&quot; mode, then click on the key to 
		select it):</p>
      <p align="center"><i>
		<img border="0" src="images/intro7_4.jpg" width="600" height="384"><br>
      Remember this?</i></p>
      <p>The main difference you'll notice now is that the &quot;Interact object&quot; 
		event already has a name. This &quot;oKey_Interact&quot; is the name of the script 
		function that we created earlier. So, just select it and click the &quot;...&quot; 
		button to return to the script editor.</p>
		<p dir="ltr">Now, we want the player to walk across to the key <b>before</b> 
		it disappears, so we need to add a new line of script <b>before</b> the 
		existing command that makes the key invisible. We want to do an action 
		on the player character (ie. move him), so type &quot;player.&quot; and 
		auto-complete will pop up with the available commands. See if you can 
		work out which one we need.</p>
      <p align="center"><i>
		<img border="1" src="images/intro7_5.jpg" width="522" height="169"><br>
      The Walk command needs X and Y co-ordinates</i></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><b>Eeek!</b> It wants a destination X and Y location! We 
		don't know that, but we can find out! Click the &quot;Room 1&quot; tab on the tab 
		bar at the top of the editor, and move the mouse cursor to where the key 
		is on the background. Look just
      above the background image, and you should see &quot;Mouse Position: 158,
      108&quot; or something similar. These are the X and Y co-ordinates,
      respectively, of the key's location. So, note them down, and click the 
		&quot;room1.asc&quot; tab to return to the script.</p>
      <p>Now, we can type in those co-ordinates to our script. We also need to 
		pass in the BlockingStyle as <i>eBlock</i>, which tells the game to wait 
		for Roger to get to those co-ordinates before continuing the script. If 
		we didn't do this, he would start to walk but the key would disappear 
		before he got there! The final script should look like this:</p>
      <p align="center"><i>
		<img border="1" src="images/intro7_6.jpg" width="331" height="143">&nbsp;<br>
      Our new command is run before the existing ones</i></p>
      <p>Now, hit F5 and try it out!<p>OK, I think we've had enough
      of animations and cutscenes for now. We'll return later to explore actual
      animations and more complex cutscenes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
