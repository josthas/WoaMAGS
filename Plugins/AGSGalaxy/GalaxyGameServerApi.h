		 *
		 * @section game-server-overview Overview
		 *
		 * Game Server API is structured in the same way as Galaxy Peer API,
		 * providing global functions called GameServerUser(), GameServerMatchmaking(),
		 * GameServerNetworking() e.t.c. defined in GalaxyGameServerApi.h header file.
		 *
		 * Objects, methods, or combinations of parameters that are not supposed to be used
		 * with Game Server, such as IUser::SetUserData(), IFriends::RequestFriendList(),
		 * IMatchmaking::SetLobbyMemberData() cause either IInvalidStateError or IInvalidArgumentError errors.
		 *
		 * Since Game Server is a separate object, and in fact operates in a separate thread,
		 * separate methods are provided to control it: InitGameServer(), ProcessGameServerData(),
		 * and ShutdownGameServer().
		 *
		 * @section game-server-listeners Listeners
		 *
		 * Corresponding global self-registering listeners are provided for all interfaces supported
		 * by the Game Server prefixed with 'GameServer': GameServerGlobalAuthListener(),
		 * GameServerGlobalLobbyEnteredListener() e.t.c.
		 *
		 * @section game-server-authentication Authentication
		 *
		 * Game Server is authenticated anonymously using the IUser::SignInAnonymous(). This method
		 * is not available for the Galaxy Peer.
		 *
		 * @section game-server-matchmaking Matchmaking and networking
		 *
		 * The Game Server is only allowed to create public non-host-migrating lobbies.
		 * Joining a specific lobby is not possible for the Game Server.
		 *
		 * While in a lobby, the Game Server operation on the server INetworking interface, so
		 * incomming packets should be handled by the IServerNetworkingListener.
