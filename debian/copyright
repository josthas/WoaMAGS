 This add-on library is provided as-is for use by the general
 public. Generally, no fees or acknowledgements are required for
 its use, except for what's detailed below. Should there be any
 questions or discrepencies in copyright or license, the
 disclaimer below shall prevail.

License: Artistic-2.0
 Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.
 .
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 Preamble
 .
 This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
 Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
 The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
 control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
 Package available as open source and free software.
 .
 You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
 license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the
 terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
 make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
 a different licensing arrangement.
 .
 Definitions
 .
 "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in
 the copyright notice for the entire Package.
 .
 "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
 material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
 procedures.
 .
 "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute,
 or modify the Package.
 .
 "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
 Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A
 given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a
 Modified Version.
 .
 "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
 accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
 organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
 .
 "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this
 Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It
 does not mean licensing fees.
 .
 "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified,
 or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the
 Copyright Holder.
 .
 "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
 changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
 .
 "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
 Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may
 be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
 .
 "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
 configuration files for the Package.
 .
 "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or
 any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation
 of the Source form.
 .
 Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
 .
 (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
 Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
 you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
 .
 Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
 .
 (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
 Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
 either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
 all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At
 your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
 Compiled form of the Package.
 .
 (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
 modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting
 Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
 will be subject to the Original License.
 .
 Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
 .
 (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
 or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
 Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
 from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
 any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
 you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
 (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the
 Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright
 Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version. (b)
 ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the
 user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the
 Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of
 the Standard Version. (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the
 Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version
 available to others under (i) the Original License or (ii) a license
 that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the
 Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy
 that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the
 Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
 available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are
 allowed.
 .
 Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified
 Versions without the Source
 .
 (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
 the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
 get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be
 valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any
 time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
 must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
 If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
 days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
 you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
 .
 (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the
 Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the
 Source of the Modified Version.
 .
 Aggregating or Linking the Package
 .
 (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
 Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
 aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
 Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
 components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
 apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
 as included in the aggregation.
 .
 (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
 other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
 build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
 include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
 provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
 .
 Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
 .
 (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
 merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
 the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not
 considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
 terms of this license.
 .
 General Provisions
 .
 (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
 Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
 modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
 use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
 license.
 .
 (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version
 made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to
 ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
 this license.
 .
 (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
 service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
 .
 (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
 free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
 sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
 patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
 infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
 that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
 infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
 date that such litigation is filed.
 .
 (14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT
 HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT
 PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT

 INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE
 OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

 Introduction
 ============
 .
  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
  FreeType Project.
 .
  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
 .
  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
 .
    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
 .
    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
 .
    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      FreeType code. (`credits')
 .
  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
 .
 .
 Legal Terms
 ===========
 .
 0. Definitions
 --------------
 .
  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
  beta or final release.
 .
  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
  engine'.
 .
  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.
 .
  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
  specified below.
 .
 1. No Warranty
 --------------
 .
  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
 .
 2. Redistribution
 -----------------
 .
  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
  herein, subject to the following conditions:
 .
    o Redistribution  of source code  must retain this  license file
      (`LICENSE.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes
      to   the  original   files  must   be  clearly   indicated  in
      accompanying  documentation.   The  copyright notices  of  the
      unaltered, original  files must be preserved in  all copies of
      source files.
 .
    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
 .
  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
  to us.
 .
 3. Advertising
 --------------
 .
  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
  purposes without specific prior written permission.
 .
  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
 .
  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
  of this license.
 .
